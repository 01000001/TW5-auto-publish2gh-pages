# Editing tiddlers
You can just edit or add new tiddlers directly on github, which is quite comfortable, or you can use a markdown editor. Tiddlywiki sintax is not exactly markdown, but it is close enough to use it as a small reference and markdown editors usually helps you completing lists and provide preview.

I recommend you to use prose:

# Prose

1. visit http://dillinger.io/
2. You can link it to github, so you can edit and save the files on your repository
3. To be able to save to github, you have to first import the tiddler you want to edit from there. The first time you will have to authorize the application:
   1. Click on `IMPORT FROM` 
   2. On the drop down select `Github`
   3. Authorize the application if needed
   4. Select the repository you want to edit, and select the master branch
   5. Navigate to `wiki`>`tiddlers` directory
   6. Select the tiddler you want to edit
4. Once you  have your "tiddler ready" click `SAVE TO` and select github
5. 

## Dilinger
To edit markdown files you have an better alternative which is dillinger. The drawback of dilinger is that it only recognices `.md` files:

1. visit http://dillinger.io/
2. You can link it to github, so you can edit and save the files on your repository
3. To be able to save to github, you have to first import the tiddler you want to edit from there. The first time you will have to authorize the application:
   1. Click on `IMPORT FROM` 
   2. On the drop down select `Github`
   3. Authorize the application if needed
   4. Select the repository you want to edit, and select the master branch
   5. Navigate to `wiki`>`tiddlers` directory
